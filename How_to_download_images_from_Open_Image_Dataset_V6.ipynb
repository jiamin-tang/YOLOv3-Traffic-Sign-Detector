And to modify images and labels so that we can use them to train YOLOv3, I used the code from [TheAIGuy](https://github.com/theAIGuysCode/OIDv4_ToolKit) and followed his [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4A9inxGqRM). This notebook serves as a summary of the aformentioned steps.\n",
